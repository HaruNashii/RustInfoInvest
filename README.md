- **RustInfoInvest**

A Very simple And Configurable Return Compost Calculator With Online Return Value Write In Rust.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This APP is under development and currently it's not a serious project, don't use it to calculate your investment return yet,


**Config**

To Change the values of the calculator you just need to edit the "config/data.ron" file


**Future Plans**
  
- A Total Value Count In Real Time
- Better UI

but i'm extremely lazy so it will probably take a long time. for now it's just one very simple calculator that you can make in 30 minutes or less


**Dependencies**

if you for some reason you want to download it you will need the sdl2 sdl2_ttf and the pkg-config packages, on arch linux you can get it with : 
- ```sudo pacman -S sdl2 sdl2_ttf pkg-config```


**Downloading And Running**

after download the dependencies you can run the "build.sh" script and run the app that will be created in "target/release".
(MAKE SURE TO RUN IT WHILE YOU ARE IN THE SAME FOLDER AS THE APP EXECUTABLE)
