**RustInfoInvest**
`A Very simple And Configurable Return Compost Calculator With Online Return Value Write In Rust.`

**Config**
`To Change the values of the calculator you just need to edit the "config/data.ron" file`

**Future Plans**
`I Planned to add more features like`
`- A Web Scrapper To Pick The Recent Return Value Of The "Poupanca" (Brasilian Investment Method)`
`- A Return Value Count To See Your "Total Value Invested + Return Value" Updated In Real Time`

`but i'm extremely buzy so it will probably take a long time. for now it's just one very simple calculator that you can make in 30 minutes or less`

**Dependencies**
`if you for some reason you want to download it you will need the sdl2 sdl2_ttf and the pkg-config packages, on arch linux you can get it with : `
- ```sudo pacman -S sdl2 sdl2_ttf pkg-config```

**Downloading And Running**
`after download the dependencies you can run the "build.sh" script and run the app that will be created in "target/release".`
`(MAKE SURE TO RUN IT WHILE YOU ARE IN THE SAME FOLDER AS THE APP EXECUTABLE)`
