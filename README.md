**Known Issues**
- ugly ui


**Config**

To Change the values of the calculator you just need click in the value and type it


**Future Plans**
Separate the Main Page values ​​with the RealTime Currency Page
- Better UI

but i'm extremely lazy so it will probably take a long time. for now it's just one very simple calculator that you can make in 30 minutes or less


**Dependencies**

if you for some reason you want to download it you will need the sdl2 sdl2_ttf and the pkg-config packages, on arch linux you can get it with : 
- ```sudo pacman -S sdl2 sdl2_ttf pkg-config geckodriver```
