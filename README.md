A Very simple Return Compost Calculator Write In Rust.

I Planned to add more features like

    A Web Scrapper To Pick The Recent Return Value Of The "Poupanca or Tesouro Selic" (Brasilian Investment Method's)
    A Return Value Count To See Your Received Return Value

but i'm extremely buzy so it will probably take a long time. for now it's just one very simple calculator that you can make in 30 minutes or less

if you for some reason you want to download it you will need the sdl2 sdl2_ttf packages, on arch linux you can get it with : sudo pacman -S sdl2 sdl2_ttf

after download the dependencies you can run the "build.sh" script and run the app that will be created in "target/release". (MAKE SURE TO RUN IT WHILE YOU ARE IN THE SAME FOLDER AS THE APP EXECUTABLE)
